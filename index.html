        <p><em><u>Stephen's Notes</u></em>:</p>
        <p>Welcome to [WEBSITE] run by Stephen and Lauren. If this is part of the first few entries to show up on your screen, then good job, you're part of my glorified experiment testing group. I hope you enjoy my personal tastes shoveled in and crammed everywhere once features start to fill up.</p>
        <p>I am this website's programmer and main developer while Lauren is the designer responsible for all of the UI you're seeing right now(courtesy to her mom for Lauren's lack of availability and technological exposure).<br><br> If you've got any feedback on anything at all or some thoughts, tell me anytime and we can do some ideacrafting together!</p>

        <p>You'll also need your own files to play on the emulator which you can source from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bsiXGznONNBy4HZklbyl2bq-DLqsNql_?usp=sharing">here</a>. NDS and N64 perform badly.
