        <p><em><u>Stephen's Notes</u></em>:</p>
        <p>Welcome to [WEBSITE] run by Stephen and Lauren. If this is part of the first few entries to show up on your screen, then good job, you're part of my glorified experiment testing group. I hope you enjoy my personal tastes shoveled in and crammed everywhere once features start to fill up.</p>
        <p>I am this website's programmer and main developer while Lauren is the designer responsible for all of the UI you're seeing right now(courtesy to her mom for Lauren's lack of availability and technological exposure).<br><br> If you've got any feedback on anything at all or some thoughts, tell me anytime and we can do some ideacrafting together!</p>

        <p>I haven't decided what to do with this section so for the time being, it will remain unused except for notes...</p>
        <p>Note: Music, Misc, and HTML5/Web from the Games section are dead links or don't lead to anywhere. </p>
        <p>In addition, the bunny sprites on your bottom left corner are your friend. They control the music toggle which is supposed to vary every page.</p>
        <p>If it doesn't automatically start playing, then you have entered the website by typing in the link instead of navigating from somewhere else(something I need to fix so it works all of the time).</p>
        <p>If something is trailing off of the page, you can scroll down it(even if I disabled the scroll bar) [only this page can scroll right now]</p>
        <p>Work will begin soon on an "about" page, more buttons, cool animations.</p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/Team-Obsidian/website-2/commits/main">Here are the github commits</a> if you are interested in the code changes(it's pretty easy actually to see what things do even if you aren't a programmer)</p>
        <p>You'll also need your own files to play on the emulator which you can source from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bsiXGznONNBy4HZklbyl2bq-DLqsNql_?usp=sharing">here</a>. As expected, things like the Nintendo DS and Nintendo 64 are laggy(but not ps1 somehow?!).
        <p>Sorry it isn't embedded, Google Drive sends back a 403 error and refuses to work otherwise.</p>
